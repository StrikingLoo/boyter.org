TLDR If you do not explicitly indicate a software license, then you have declared an implicit copyright without explaining how others can use it.

Most jurisdictions have some concept that is more or less similar to public domain. 

Only some countries allow to explicitly assign a work to public domain, this is not possible in Germany and Australia by contrast. So in many jurisdictions a work only becomes public domain, if the time for exclusive rights expire, which can be 70 years after the authors death.


"Having no license at all" is not at all the same thing as being in the public domain.




Generally it is better to not public domain code but instead put it under a permissive license like MIT if that is your intention.
