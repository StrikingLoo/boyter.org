Since I have been working on searchcode for a while and its getting close to being ready for release (a few weeks away at this point I predict) I thought I would post a teaser screenshot.

The below shows how it looks for a sample search. The design is far cleaner then what is currently online which is a big win as the current design of searchcode is seriously ugly.

I still have quite a way to go before this is ready to be released, but it is getting closer. Will continue to post updates as I get closer to the release date along with how I migrated from an old PHP codebase to a Python one.
