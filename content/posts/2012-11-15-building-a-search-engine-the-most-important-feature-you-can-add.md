**TL/DR** Part of the genius behind DuckDuckGo customer retention is the [!bang feature][1]. Every new search engine should implement it while trying to gain traction.

Let me explain. Your current search engine is like a favorite couch. Its comfortable, familiar and you have been using it for years. Switching is not a comfortable experience.

    Im a search engine junkie. The moment I discover a new one I switch my defaults over to it and for a period of about a week use it day to day. <a href="http://www.altavista.com/">Altavista</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a>, <a href="http://www.bing.com/">MSN</a>, <a href="http://www.bing.com/">Live</a>, <a href="http://www.bing.com/">Bing</a>, <a href="http://www.gigablast.com/">Gigablast</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuil">Cuil</a>, <a href="http://blekko.com/">Blekko</a>, <a href="http://baidu.com/">Baidu</a>, <a href=" http://www.yandex.com/">Yandex</a>, <a href="https://ixquick.com/">IxQuick</a>, <a href="http://www.ask.com/">Ask</a>, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo (DDG)</a>, <a href="http://www.verticalset.com/">Verticalset</a>, <a href="http://millionshort.com/">Millionshort</a>. I have tried them all and those are just a few of the General Purpose search engines.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Just recently a new one popped up, <a href="http://www.procog.com/">Procog</a>. I have always had a great deal of respect for Matt Wells (technical guy behind Procog), things like his <a href="http://www.gigablast.com/rants.html">technical rants</a>, this <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=988401">technical interview</a> and <a href="http://www.gigablast.com/">Gigablast</a> itself are pretty impressive. I think the results are pretty good (for most of the queries I have tried), and I really like the transparency behind the ranking algorithm. The catch? The same one that gets me nearly *every* time I try a new search engine; any query that dosn&#8217;t give me the results I need. It may be because the engine is lacking or it could be because I don&#8217;t know how to bend it to my will. Either way, it&#8217;s crippling.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>The solution.</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    DDG&#8217;s !bang syntax solved this by allowing me to easily redirect my query when I find it lacking. When I think Google might have a result DDG dosn&#8217;t I add !g to confirm. The more I do this and refine my behaviour the more confidence I have in DDG&#8217;s abilities.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Guess what? Despite DDG not working 100% of the time for me im still using it as my default search engine. Im even <a href="http://duckduckhack.com/"><strong>contributing</strong></a> to it. Why? Because when I hit one of those edge cases where I am not comfortable I can revert with 3 extra keystrokes !g This is <strong>great</strong> user experience.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So&#8230;. Working on a new search engine? Want me to use it? Want to retain me as a user?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then do me a favor, while im getting familiar with it&#8217;s quirks, allow me to easily switch to something im comfortable with. I want to like your search engine. I really want to try your search engine. Implement !bang&#8217;s before working on your awesome Google beating algorithms and you will get my attention for at least a week, and if you <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/privacy.html">offer</a> <a href="http://procog.com/help/rank_details">something</a> <a href="http://www.verticalset.com/documentation/index">different</a> you might get it for longer then that.
