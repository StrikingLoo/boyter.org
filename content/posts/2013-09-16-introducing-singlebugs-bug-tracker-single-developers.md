Introducing the first beta release of SingleBugs, the bug tracker aimed at single/solo developers. Are you a solo developer? Do you find setting up Mantis/Fogbugs/Bugs.net/et.al too complex and a waste of your time? Do you want a single solution that easily syncs and backs up between your machines? Try SingleBugs.

Guaranteed to save you time and money setting up a bug tracker. Guaranteed to be the fastest bug tracker you have ever used.

No set-up required. Simple backups. Instant searching. Easily exportable.

With the marketing spiel over give it a shot. Currently only available for Windows x64 and Linux x64. Download the demo below and give it a shot.
