Well I finally got around to doing what I always said I would. That being launch and online business. Inspired by all of the stories and discussions at news.ycombinator.com and in particular this single post <http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1560422> I decided to finish off those projects that I have been working on for a while and launch.

Naturally following the experience of the greats who have done it themselves, such as Patrick with Bingo Card Creator and Peldi of Balsamiq I thought I would throw up a blog, pick a theme quickly and get started.

Anyway more will be coming in the next few days, but I think blogging about the experience while I go should be helpful. My goal is to post a blog post every day for my own reference even if nobody ever reads them.
