This serves as the announcement of my new bug tracker product I am working on.

My needs are pretty specific and none of the existing bug trackers I have tried have meet the following goals.

  * Speed. Searching, adding projects/issues/comments should be instant. Any time waiting on the bug tracker is wasted time.
  * Outlook style view of projects/issues/comments. This should allow me to get an overview of how I am tracking.
  * Not require me to spin up a full web-server. I don&#8217;t want to have to install a full stack web-server just to track bugs.
  * Sync across all devices. I want it to just appear on every device I own without me having to worry about backups or keeping things in sync.
  * Be single user. I don&#8217;t want to have to login or perform user management.
  * Support multiple projects. I also want to be able to have multiple issues per project.

With that in mind let me introduce the Fizzbuzz Bug Tracker. Fizzbuzz is a single executable that works on Windows, Linux and OSX (once I have a machine to compile it on). A suggested workflow is to copy it onto your Dropbox folder (or equivalent) where it will be synced across all devices. Fizzbuzz has a strong emphasis on speed. Adding projects or issues, searching across projects and issues, drilling into projects or issues is near instant.

Fizzbuzz spins up its own web-server running on whatever port you choose (defaults to 8080) allowing you to use it without installing any additional software. Fizzbuzz has no user login&#8217;s so getting started is very fast.

Interested? Let me know. Its getting very close to having a public release at which point I will probably choose a real name for it. If you would like to get access sooner rather then later email me or bitmessage me (details on the right bar and about page).
