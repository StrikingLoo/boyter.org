As much as I like things to be perfect I soon discovered from my [startup camp experience][1] that its far more important to have a minimum viable product out there and generating interest. After all how can you determine how worthwhile your time investment is without throwing out your ideas and testing the reaction. That's always something scary for any developer, but probably is the correct approach.

And so I am releasing a quick weekend project I created when I became interested in Google's Instant search. Welcome to <http://www.searchforphp.com/> which is my first real attempt at anything interesting with jQuery and using my search skills. Essentially its a search engine totally focused on PHP. Feel free to give it a whirl. Some queries work better then others on it, but "mysql" is a pretty good search term. At the moment its just showing the results from RSS feeds that are being crawled and the function list in PHP but it is a pretty good start. Let me know what you think in the comments below.
