I'm still new to consulting but here are a few things that spring to mind which you should look at carefully.

  1. Make sure you have the required access to do the job initially.
  2. Find out the exact requirements, how are they doing it, what do they want, what are they looking to get out of it?
  3. Provide regular updates to avoid having the client follow you up.
  4. Write scripts which verify the environments which already exist. This is essential when it comes to migrations and ensures nothing is broken while you are doing the changes.
