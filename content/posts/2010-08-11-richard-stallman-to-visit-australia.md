Im not usually one to promote events and the like unless I feel there is a genuine benefit to be had by attending but this is one stands out. Richard M Stallman, the guru of Free Software is coming Down Under to hold a talk. You can read about him here, [Open Source Celebrity to visit Australia][1]

You can register for the event at the [ACS Website][2]

I am certainly planning on attending.
