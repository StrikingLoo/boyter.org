Google has just annouced that they are killing off two new products, Buzz and Google Code search [(read here)][1]. Buzz is a no brainer (although I am certain someone out there is using it) but code search is a little sad. Its also both annoying and an opportunity for http://searchco.de/

Its annoying because I have branch in my source control which integrates with Google code search. I was about to push it out too. This kills a few hours integration work which is annoying. I can understand Googles point of view though. I imagine that the Grep code search was rather CPU heavy and that storing all that source code (including versions) would have really eaten up some disk space. I would be curious to see their stats though as im certain there is enough traffic there to make something viable.

Nevermind, it means that there are opportunities for others to do so. I may even look into it myself. In other news however responding to feedback I have integrated some of the Cobol intrinsic functions into the search results. You can search for them [COBOL][2]
