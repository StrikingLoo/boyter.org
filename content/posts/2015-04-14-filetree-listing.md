Just a quick update to searchcode. A few small tweaks here and there, but the largest is that there is now a file tree listing option which will show the file tree for any project. An example would be going to [this file][1] and then clicking the &#8220;View File Tree&#8221; button on the top left.

An example screenshot of the result of this is included below.
