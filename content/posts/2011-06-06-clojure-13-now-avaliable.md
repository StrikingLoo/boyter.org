Added Clojure 1.3 documentation today. The Clojure language itself is pretty tight, but its nice to have something to browse through when looking for some elusive method.

You can view it by searching for [clojure][1]

One thing I have discovered while doing this is that if I have a slight amount of familiarity with the language it really makes parsing it easier. This stands to reason as I can pick up errors more easily, but somewhat surprising. Another thought is that I think there should be a standard for programming language documentation. Every language has its own which means each one needs a specialised parser.

The bad thing about about standards? There are so many.
