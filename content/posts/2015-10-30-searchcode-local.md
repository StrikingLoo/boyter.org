I am going to copy the searchcode pitch itself below quickly before explaining it a bit further.

&#8220;searchcode offers powerful code search over billions of lines of open source code. Imagine what it could do with your private repositories.

There have been requests to offer a downloadable version of searchcode. Given enough interest a downloadable hostable version of searchcode will be offered. Register your email below to register your interest.

Note that there would be a free Community version available for all users as well as paid version offering support. Functionality would remain the same across all versions. This would be similar to how [Octopus Deploy][1] is offered.&#8221;

In short I am considering writing a hostable version of searchcode. Most likely it would consist of a Java application one could download and use to get similar results to searchcode.com itself (probably at smaller scale however).

Rather then actually commit to several months worth of work however I have put a message on searchcode asking for those interested to [register their interest][2]. If it sounds like something you would like please register.

I have no signup target numbers in mind or product costs etc&#8230; but I suspect given over 100 sign-ups I will actually go forth and implement.

I should note that this is something I have been highly resistant towards for a long time as I do not really want to get into enterprise sales cycles.

Anyway in a months time if there are enough signups I will push forward and release an initial version to those who have signed up. Any one who does will get free access on the beta list and discounts on the final version (should they need something more powerful then the community edition).

This has been released and you can now get the [actual product][2].
