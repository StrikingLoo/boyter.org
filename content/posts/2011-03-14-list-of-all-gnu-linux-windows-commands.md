Today I can announce a small but possibly useful feature which is the addition of lists. They are here as way of making it easier to find what you are looking for if the main search lets you down and you want to try a browser inline search. They can also be useful if you just want to scroll through everything in a particular subject. I have the following lists already created,

  * <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://searchco.de/lists/list-of-gnu-linux-commands">List of all GNU/Linux Commands</a>
  * <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://searchco.de/lists/list-of-windows-commands">List of all Windows Commands</a>

As always I am open to suggestions of more lists to compile, and will annouce them through this blog as I continue to update things.
