Hello All!

Hope you are having a wonderful day.

So I am Ben. I am a technical lead for Kablamo which means "codemoney". As you are probably aware my talk is about a command line tool I created. The talk is name "Sloc Cloc and Code - Can a crusty Go program outperform a well written Rust Project?"

As I mentioned I work for Kablamo. Kablamo builds a lot of custom software on AWS. Our backend language of choice is Go which was a problem for me because I didn't know it.

As such I was working on projects in other languages such as C# and Java.
