A few days ago there was a lack of speakers for #SyPy which is the Sydney Python meet-up held most months and sponsored by Atlassian. I had previously put my hand up to help out if this situation ever came up and was mostly ready with a presentation about Decoding Captchas. I did not expect it to be so full that people were standing (largest crowd I had ever seen there). Thankfully it seemed to go over well and while I need to get more practice at public speaking I did enjoy it. A few choice tweets that came out of the end of the event,
