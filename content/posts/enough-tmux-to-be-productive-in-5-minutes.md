tmux the terminal multiplexer is one of those brilliant tools I use all day. I am not a tmux expert, nor do I have any need to be. What follows is the bare minimum you need to know to feel productive in tmux, written for some work colleagues.

The following assumes you have not configured or tweaked tmux in any way opting for the default settings.

From the command line to start or connect to tmux

 - `tmux` start a new tmux session
 - `tmux ls` view the current active sessions
 - `tmux attach -t 0` attach to one of the tmux sessions listed from `ls` where you replace 0 with some number

Once inside tmux

 - `Ctrl+B d` detach from the current session
 - To quit the current session type and enter exit till you are kicked out and you can use this to close sessions you have split horizontally or vertically
 - `Ctrl+B s` view the current active sessions, then use up and down keys to highlight and enter to select
 - `Ctrl+B '` split the current session window horizontally 
 - `Ctrl+B %` split the current session window vertically
 - `Ctrl+B Alt+↓` expand the current active session window down, if you have split horizontally you can do this, you can push the Alt+↓ key multiple times to keep pushing down
 - `Ctrl+B Alt+↑` expand the current active session window up, if you have split horizontally you can do this, you can push the Alt+↑ key multiple times to keep pushing down
 - `Ctrl+B Alt+→` expand the current active session window right, if you have split vertically you can do this, you can push the Alt+→ key multiple times to keep pushing right
 - `Ctrl+B Alt+←` expand the current active session window left, if you have split vertically you can do this, you can push the Alt+← key multiple times to keep pushing left
 - `Ctrl+B ↓` move the current active session window to the one below
 - `Ctrl+B ↑` move the current active session window to the one above
 - `Ctrl+B →` move the current active session window to the one right
 - `Ctrl+B ←` move the current active session window to the one left
 - `Ctrl+B [` scroll mode
 - `Ctrl+B space` start copy/yank mode when in scroll mode
 - `Ctrl+B w` copy selection in scroll mode

Thats about all you need. Its all I ever use on a day to day basis.
