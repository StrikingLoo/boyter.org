> Verism is the artistic preference of contemporary everyday subject matter instead of the heroic or legendary in art and literature; it is a form of realism. The word comes from Latin verus (true). 

> Verism, often described as "warts and all," shows the imperfections of the subject, such as warts, wrinkles, and furrows.

Realisim is one of those things I really value in movies. When I write that I mean realistic actions. I am prepared to accept that magic and superpowers exist so long as the characters act in a real way. The classic example that breaks this rule is the character in the horror film, knowing that something is out there murdering people they are associated with decides after hearing strange noises in their dark empty house to go check it out by themselves.

What I also like is following the hero, as they face setback after setback, growing and learning to overcome the challange. Its cliche but a very common novel and movie format. 

Interesting side note, Back to the Future is the only movie I can think of where the main character learns nothing nor grows as a person and is still close to being a perfect movie.

Probably one of my favoite blog posts to re-read that follows this style is https://mailinator.blogspot.com.au/2012/02/how-mailinator-compresses-email-by-90.html where a problem is presented, a solution tried and discarded and a new one attemped till you reach the eventual goal. I like it because I like to imagine myself working through a problem in a similar way.

I am an average developer at best but I doubt even the very best coders out there solve many solutions perfectly on the first try. I want to see the process behind the creation of the magic they publish. I like hearing about how someone explored using different queue's before discovering their real issue was how they were using it and they could replace the whole thing with a array.
