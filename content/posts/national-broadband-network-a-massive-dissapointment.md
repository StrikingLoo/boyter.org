title: The National Broadband Network (NBN) A Massive Dissapointment

I write this mostly so I can move on. The NBN has been a source of constant frustration and anger for me. While I will never forgive those who caused the current shambles I can perhaps redirect my anger elsewhere will keeping it in the back of my mind.


So here is my brief timeline of NBN.

Moved to area that was due to get NBN FTTP in ~2014. With the change in government that ended up going away. I was then promised by Senator Fifield (who replaced Malcolm Turnbull as communications Minister) that NBN would start contruction in 2016. This however was also pushed back to 2017. It was then pushed out to 2018. Pushed back 3 times in 2018. Finally told it will be done in June 2019.

Despite being years late and many areas now getting the far better option of FTTC I was slated to get FTTN. August rolls around and the node appears (literally on the eve of the federal election). June arrives, and I go to connect. I was able to pre-register with Aussie Broadband. However apparently, something else needed to be fixed. Wait till July. Suddenly my ADSL2+ connection drops from 19 Mbps to 3 Mbps. Talk to NBN who say talk to ISP who say talk to Telstra. Still shitty connection. Finally get that resolved so I am back to 11 Mbps. NBN works have caused me to loose 8 Mbps of speed.

So I wonder what the fuck is going on. Notice they are installing a new pillar. That's right, a new fucking pillar and running the copper to the node which is about 200m away. My guess is that the copper runs back and forth so everyone just got an additional 200m of copper length added to everyone. So thinking all is good, check... still cannot connect. Days pass. Notice a truck near the node. They are patching the ground around it which had collapsed and while doing that flushing the ducts and at the same time refitting the copper lines.

Still not connected at the end of July with no ETA. The NBN website insists I can connect last month still.

In short, NBN so far has made a path I would walk on dangerous, dropped my speed by 30% and thats about it. What a fucking colossal turkey. Turnbull and Abbott better pray I never come to power because I will strip them of all their assets and have them whipped through every town in Australia using copper wire if I do.



The most annoying thing being that the FTTN node was installed 2 years ago and has been powered since then. It knocked out my ADSL2+ from 19 Mbps down to 3 Mbps. I complained, and it took a while and after a lot of running around its up to 10 Mbps. So all I have seen since the NBN turned up is my solid connection drop in speed 50% and become unstable.

Its not fun watching literally everyone at work getting their connections upgraded. Most going from 100/40 to 250/25 or 1000/50 while I am waiting to get the thing and knowing that no matter what the best I can hope for is 100/40 while the only guarantee I have for the first 18 months is 12/1. So its entirely possible I will get about a 40% downgrade in speed and there is no recourse for me.

My biggest complaint about the NBN though is the unfairness of it. I am going to get a worse connection than others, and there is nothing I can do about it other than potentially fork out $30,000+ which is also FAR beyond the $3,000 Turnbull said it would cost. For the record were it to cost $3,000 to move to FTTP I would do it instantly, and then become one of those 1000/50 subscribers.






Every suburb around us is able to connect, with a mix of HFC, FTTC and FTTN connections. The suburbs with the better connections are seeing house prices increase.


Bought a house in the area because expected to get FTTP in 2013-14. 7 years after I was meant to get FTTP, and promised FTTN in 2016 (by the communication Minister at the time Fifield while campaigning), the node installed in 2018 I finally am connected... in mid 2020. After all that, I only get a sync speed of 77/38 after having to pay out of pocket to bypass all internal wiring (cunning evil to reduce CAPEX and push it back on the users) and have the lead in direct to the modem. Not high enough for me to consider paying the extra for speed I won't get.

I think the NBN can be described by me with one word. Disappointment. I was thinking, at what point would I have not been disappointed... 100/40 would still have been disappointing, but I think had I gotten 1000/400 I would have been satisfied. That seems to be a speed that literally changes the game in terms of how I would use the internet. As it is, I am going to be stuck on 50/20. I thought watching people get upgraded to the 250/1000 plans was bad before I was connected, but now its doubly frustrating knowing I will only ever get a 1/5 of the download performance they get, and while my upload is similar thats only because if stupid asymmetrical plans designed to not make the network look bad.

I don't see how anyone can defend the NBN. In my local area they seem to have placed the node such that nobody can get 100/40 based on the local community chat. Heck most of those who connected cancelled in 1 day and went back to mobile because they get better more reliable performance.

So this ends my interest in the project. Id like to live in hope that one day in the future I will wake up, and see that Australia has invested in something that makes us a world leader. All we ever seem to get is a massive waste of money, lots of corruption and an output that is worse than what countries literally run by drug lords receive.

Anyway thats the end of it. 7 years wait for internet that I guess might be the envy of people living in Libya, and the worst part? I am considered on of the lucky FTTN users. All I know is that the LNP has lost a vote for life over this, and I will always preference them last over literally anyone else for this.

I have always thought, even if I was unable to explain it at times, that when you are spending public money such as was done for the NBN that you have an obligation towards fairness. While it will never be equitable to all due to distance and lifestyle choices, nessisitating the fixed wireless and satellite footprint the original 93% fiber roll-out felt fair.
