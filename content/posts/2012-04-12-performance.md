Just a quick blog post to point out that some speed improvements have been implemented. I have a few more tricks to roll out soon but on the whole things are much more snappy now. I have also been modifying my indexers and can now update the index ad-hoc rather then in large batches.

I have some more stuff coming soon including search restricted to languages EG Java / C++ and an updated code view.

Finally I added some CSS3 rounded corners to a few things because it makes the design look much better then before.
