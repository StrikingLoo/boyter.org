A new tool.

Interestingly has the opposite problem to search engines where preranking is hard and query time ranking is the only option.

I guess its possible to build a tf-idf into the application itself, but constructing it on the fly is going to be fairly hard.

As such something like tf-idf is not really the best option.

One search ranking technique that does work well like this however is my old favorite the vector space model.
