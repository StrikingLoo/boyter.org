Today I presented at the Sydney Dev Warriors meet-up about a project I was working on from the start to end of 2018. In a nutshell it was a self serve digital archive for video, audio, images and metadata.

Since I am in the habit of collecting everything I do into one place I chose to do the presentation using reveal.js which means I can also include it here. [How AWS and Go Transformed a Public Broadcasters Digital Archive](https://boyter.org/static/aws-go-archive-presso/).
