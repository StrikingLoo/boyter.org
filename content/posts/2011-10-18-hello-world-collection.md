I was looking through the logs of what people are searching for and noticed there is a large amount of "Hello World" searches such as "hello world java" which actually came up with no results. I couldn't have that continue so I quickly integrated the [Hello World Collection][1]

You can now search for hello world in 400+ languages (although curiously no in Clojure). Just type hello world and the language you are searching for EG,

[helloworld java][2]
  
[hello world lisp][3]
  
[hello world php][4]
