Just a quick post to show off the new searchcode.com logo. I have been working on a new version of the site for a few weeks now and want to get something out there for people to look at. Design wise its not done yet, but the logo is.

There it is in all its glory. The new design has a similar look and I should be able to start talking about and showing it off soon. Things I can mention are,

  * Moving away from PHP to Python (Django) for the web server.
  * Twitter Bootstrap used for the design.
  * Large amount of tests which should hopefully fix some some known issues.
  * A full writeup of the conversion to follow!

Lastly I am looking at creating a self hosted version of searchcode for people to download and use themselves. If you are interested in running a version let me know via a comment or better yet email me.
