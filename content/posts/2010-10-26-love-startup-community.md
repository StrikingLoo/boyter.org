Just yesterday I announced my new [PHP search][1] website on [Hacker News][2]. Not only did I get a great reception I received lots of good honest feedback which allowed me to iterate and create a better experience.

All good stuff. The best however was yet to come. One of the things I wanted to do was use [DuckDuckGo's !bang syntax][3] which I think is totally awesome for quick searches where the general search engine dosn't come up with the goods. In the spirit of the community I asked [Gabriel Weinburg][4] if I could borrow his syntax to integrate. The exact response? ["np! I'd be flattered :)"][5] The best was yet to come. Assuming that SearchForPHP is doing a better job of search then php.net Gabriel has integrated his !php syntax to point at my site!

This is the community I want to belong to for as long as I live. People doing cool stuff just because its cool. People helping each other out because its the ethical thing to do. People just being part of a community that grows and nurtures, without flames putdown's, fear or resentment.

A big shout out to Gabriel, to everyone on Hacker News and anyone else involved in the startup world. I feel I have a second home :)
